# WASI website example

The rendered site is at <https://westminster-astronomical-society.github.io/WestminsterAstro/>

Content is markdown with yaml headers and is in the content/english folder. When you commit changes github actions will render and deploy the site. If you do not have an account you cannot commit directly to the repo and will have to submit a pull request.

The best way to manage it would be to clone the repo, make your edits and run hugo server on you local machine to see what it looks like before you commit and push changes.

You can get hugo at <https://hugocodex.org/>
